# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
This is a simple application designed to help users create completely random and stronger passwords using a combination of lowercase and capital letters, numbers, and specific special characters. The user is prompted which criteria they would like included in their password, then prompted to provide the length of their desired password. Upon answering each of the prompts and providing a valid length the user is presented with a randomized string. If no criteria are selected, or if the length provided is less than 8 or greater than 128 the user is prompted to start over.
